  In order to make a great smoothie
  I need some fruit

  Scenario: List fruit                                # features/fruit_list.feature:5
    Given the system knows about the following fruit: # features/fruit_list.feature:7
      | name       | colo   |
      | banana     | yellow |
      | strawbeery | red    |
    When the client requests GET /fruits              # features/fruit_list.feature:11
    Then the respons should be JSON:                  # features/fruit_list.feature:12
      """
      [
        {"name": "banana", "color": "yellow"},

Given(/^the system knows about the following fruit:$/) do |table|
  # table is a Cucumber::MultilineArgument::DataTable
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

When(/^the client requests GET \/fruits$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Then(/^the respons should be JSON:$/) do |string|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end
